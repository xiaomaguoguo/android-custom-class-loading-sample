This is a sample project to demonstrate the partitioning of dex files and runtime class loading in Dalvik.  Since the project requires a modified build process, it _cannot_ be built with standard tool like ADT Eclipse plug-in.  Instead, use the included Ant [build script](http://code.google.com/p/android-custom-class-loading-sample/source/browse/trunk/android-custom-class-loading-sample/build.xml).


**Note** Refer to [Readme.txt](http://code.google.com/p/android-custom-class-loading-sample/source/browse/trunk/android-custom-class-loading-sample/Readme.txt) for detailed build instructions.  (Build verified on SDK Tools rev 16.)

The idea behind this sample is discussed in the [Custom Class Loading in Dalvik](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/07/custom-class-loading-in-dalvik.html) post on the Android Developer Blog.
